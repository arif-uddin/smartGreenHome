# Smart Green Home
This is a smart home where security has been prioritized and smart farming is available.
Smart farming allows automated watering the plants when needed through the reading of soil moisture as well as provides the reading of temperature, humidity by various sensors.
There are sensors which detects human presence and motion on corridor and staircase area and turns on light when detected and that's how incompetence interference can be found out. User can turn on/off light, fan using android app and website also and this home has several alerts for smoke, gas, fire by lighting up a red LED and alarms.

This project contains a RFID accessing system. It also has some exciting features. Such as 
•	Automatic light on/off.
•	Fan on/off or control from anywhere via using apps.
•	Automatic smoke detection.
•	Gas leakage & system can be notified alarm & user get notification from apps.
•	DHT11 to read the value of Temperature and Humidity.
•	Automatic corridor light on/off using PIR and sonar sensor.

Tools List
•	Node MCU esp8266
•	RFID
•	5V LED light
•	Arduino nano
•	Relay module
•	Servo motor
•	Sonar sensor
•	PIR
•	DHT11 etc.
